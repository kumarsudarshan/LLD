# Design Splitwise

### Create an expense sharing application.
```
An expense sharing application is where you can add your expenses 
and split it among different people. 
The app keeps balances between people as in who owes how much to whom.

Example
You live with 3 other friends.
You: User1 (id: u1)
Flatmates: User2 (u2), User3 (u3), User4 (u4)
```
