# Tic-Tac-Toe

Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on NxN grid.

You may assume the following rules:

- A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
- Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
- A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

    * Game has 3 modes: Human Vs Human, Human Vs Computer and Computer Vs Computer.
    * Initially start with a 3X3 grid, but it can be generalised to NXN grid. So donâ€™t hardcode any variable.
    * Try to cover maximum number of edge cases, like when to abort the game, draw condition, win condition, overwriting the existing value in grid etc)
